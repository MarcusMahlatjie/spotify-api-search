# Spotify API search app using NodeJS

Node.js app that depends on user input from the terminal to retrieve some information from the Spotify API. It uses API calls and parse through returned JSON objects, outputting them in a 
specified format. The program should make a request to the Spotify API, and fetch a JSON object that 
includes the artist(s), song, preview link, and album.
